 *  associated to a file (a regular file, a directory or a symbolic link). Thus, the inode must be in use and belong
 *  to one of the legal file types.
 *

 *  \param buff pointer to the buffer where data must be written from

 *  \return -\c EINVAL, if the <em>inode number</em> or the <em>index to the list of direct references</em> are out of
 *                      range or the <em>pointer to the buffer area</em> is \c NULL

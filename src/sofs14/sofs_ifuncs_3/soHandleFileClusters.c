/**
 *  \brief Handle all data clusters from the list of references starting at a given point.
 *
 *  The file (a regular file, a directory or a symlink) is described by the inode it is associated to.
 *
 *  Several operations are available and can be applied to the file data clusters starting from the index to the list of
 *  direct references which is given.
 *
 *  The list of valid operations is
 *
 *    \li FREE:       free all data clusters starting from the referenced data cluster
 *    \li FREE_CLEAN: free all data clusters starting from the referenced data cluster and dissociate them from the
 *                    inode which describes the file
 *    \li CLEAN:      dissociate all data clusters starting from the referenced data cluster from the inode which
 *                    describes the file.
 *
 *  Depending on the operation, the field <em>clucount</em> and the lists of direct references, single indirect
 *  references and double indirect references to data clusters of the inode associated to the file are updated.
 *
 *  Thus, the inode must be in use and belong to one of the legal file types for the operations FREE and FREE_CLEAN and
 *  must be free in the dirty state for the operation CLEAN.
 *
 *  \param nInode number of the inode associated to the file
 *  \param clustIndIn index to the list of direct references belonging to the inode which is referred (it contains the
 *                    index of the first data cluster to be processed)
 *  \param op operation to be performed (FREE, FREE AND CLEAN, CLEAN)
 *
 *  \return <tt>0 (zero)</tt>, on success
 *  \return -\c EINVAL, if the <em>inode number</em> or the <em>index to the list of direct references</em> are out of
 *                      range or the requested operation is invalid
 *  \return -\c EIUININVAL, if the inode in use is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c EFDININVAL, if the free inode in the dirty state is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c ELDCININVAL, if the list of data cluster references belonging to an inode is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c EDCINVAL, if the data cluster header is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c EWGINODENB, if the <em>inode number</em> in the data cluster <tt>status</tt> field is different from the
 *                          provided <em>inode number</em> (FREE AND CLEAN / CLEAN)
 *  \return -\c ELIBBAD, if some kind of inconsistency was detected at some internal storage lower level
 *  \return -\c EBADF, if the device is not already opened
 *  \return -\c EIO, if it fails reading or writing
 *  \return -<em>other specific error</em> issued by \e lseek system call

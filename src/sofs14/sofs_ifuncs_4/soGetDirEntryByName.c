/**
 *  \brief Get an entry by name.
 *
 *  The directory contents, seen as an array of directory entries, is parsed to find an entry whose name is
 *  <tt>eName</tt>. Thus, the inode associated to the directory must be in use and belong to the directory type.
 *
 *  The <tt>eName</tt> must also be a <em>base name</em> and not a <em>path</em>, that is, it can not contain the
 *  character '/'.
 *
 *  The process that calls the operation must have execution (x) permission on the directory.
 *
 *  \param nInodeDir number of the inode associated to the directory
 *  \param eName pointer to the string holding the name of the directory entry to be located
 *  \param p_nInodeEnt pointer to the location where the number of the inode associated to the directory entry whose
 *                     name is passed, is to be stored
 *                     (nothing is stored if \c NULL)
 *  \param p_idx pointer to the location where the index to the directory entry whose name is passed, or the index of
 *               the first entry that is free in the clean state, is to be stored
 *               (nothing is stored if \c NULL)
 *
 *  \return <tt>0 (zero)</tt>, on success
 *  \return -\c EINVAL, if the <em>inode number</em> is out of range or the pointer to the string is \c NULL or the
 *                      name string does not describe a file name
 *  \return -\c ENAMETOOLONG, if the name string exceeds the maximum allowed length
 *  \return -\c ENOTDIR, if the inode type is not a directory
 *  \return -\c ENOENT,  if no entry with <tt>name</tt> is found
 *  \return -\c EACCES, if the process that calls the operation has not execution permission on the directory
 *  \return -\c EDIRINVAL, if the directory is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c EDEINVAL, if the directory entry is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c EIUININVAL, if the inode in use is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c ELDCININVAL, if the list of data cluster references belonging to an inode is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c ELIBBAD, if some kind of inconsistency was detected at some internal storage lower level
 *  \return -\c EBADF, if the device is not already opened
 *  \return -\c EIO, if it fails reading or writing
 *  \return -<em>other specific error</em> issued by \e lseek system call

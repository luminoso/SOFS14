/**
 *  \brief Add a generic entry / attach an entry to a directory to a directory.
 *
 *  In the first case, a generic entry whose name is <tt>eName</tt> and whose inode number is <tt>nInodeEnt</tt> is added
 *  to the directory associated with the inode whose number is <tt>nInodeDir</tt>. Thus, both inodes must be in use and
 *  belong to a legal type, the former, and to the directory type, the latter.
 *
 *  Whenever the type of the inode associated to the entry to be added is of directory type, the directory is initialized
 *  by setting its contents to represent an empty directory.
 *
 *  In the second case, an entry to a directory whose name is <tt>eName</tt> and whose inode number is <tt>nInodeEnt</tt>
 *  is attached to the directory, the so called <em>base directory</em>, associated to the inode whose number is
 *  <tt>nInodeDir</tt>. The entry to be attached is supposed to represent itself a fully organized directory, the so
 *  called <em>subsidiary directory</em>. Thus, both inodes must be in use and belong to the directory type.
 *
 *  The <tt>eName</tt> must be a <em>base name</em> and not a <em>path</em>, that is, it can not contain the
 *  character '/'. Besides there should not already be any entry in the directory whose <em>name</em> field is
 *  <tt>eName</tt>.
 *
 *  The <em>refcount</em> field of the inode associated to the entry to be added / updated and, when required, of the
 *  inode associated to the directory are updated. This may also happen to the <em>size</em> field of either or both
 *  inodes.
 *
 *  The process that calls the operation must have write (w) and execution (x) permissions on the directory.
 *
 *  \param nInodeDir number of the inode associated to the directory
 *  \param eName pointer to the string holding the name of the entry to be added / attached
 *  \param nInodeEnt number of the inode associated to the entry to be added / attached
 *  \param op type of operation (ADD / ATTACH)
 *
 *  \return <tt>0 (zero)</tt>, on success
 *  \return -\c EINVAL, if any of the <em>inode numbers</em> are out of range or the pointer to the string is \c NULL
 *                      or the name string does not describe a file name or no operation of the defined class is described
 *  \return -\c ENAMETOOLONG, if the name string exceeds the maximum allowed length
 *  \return -\c ENOTDIR, if the inode type whose number is <tt>nInodeDir</tt> (ADD), or both the inode types (ATTACH),
 *                       are not directories
 *  \return -\c EEXIST, if an entry with the <tt>eName</tt> already exists
 *  \return -\c EACCES, if the process that calls the operation has not execution permission on the directory where the
 *                      entry is to be added / attached
 *  \return -\c EPERM, if the process that calls the operation has not write permission on the directory where the entry
 *                     is to be added / attached
 *  \return -\c EMLINK, if the maximum number of hardlinks in either one of inodes has already been attained
 *  \return -\c EFBIG, if the directory where the entry is to be added / attached, has already grown to its maximum size
 *  \return -\c ENOSPC, if there are no free data clusters
 *  \return -\c EDIRINVAL, if the directory is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c EDEINVAL, if the directory entry is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c EIUININVAL, if the inode in use is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c ELDCININVAL, if the list of data cluster references belonging to an inode is inconsistent
 *  \return -\c EDCMINVAL, if the mapping association of the data cluster is invalid
 *  \return -\c ELIBBAD, if some kind of inconsistency was detected at some internal storage lower level
 *  \return -\c EBADF, if the device is not already opened
 *  \return -\c EIO, if it fails reading or writing
 *  \return -<em>other specific error</em> issued by \e lseek system call
